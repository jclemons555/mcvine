Dockerfiles for installing mcvine
---------------------------------

Each subdir here is for one operating system.
For example, ubuntu is one such subdir.

In each subdir, there are subsubdirs for different versions
of the same OS.
For example, ubuntu/14.04 is one such subsubdir.

In each subsubdir, there are following subsubsubdirs:

* deps:  Dockerfile to build all dependencies
* build: Dockerfile to build mcvine
