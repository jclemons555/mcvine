  average_mass, scattering_xs and absorption_xs: optional. 
    if not set, they will
    be computed from unitcell info in Ni.xyz
    here we set scattering_xs to 18.5 barn, the total scattering cross
    section that is the sum of incoherent and coherent scattering cross
    sections. This way, we can use the incoherent kernel to approximate
    the total scattering.
    Note: be very careful when customizing cross sections.
      They are the total scattering cross sections from
      the whole unit cell.
